A Simple Game
I hope you all are familiar with the game where you have a hammer and you need to hit something that pop out from any hole, Since i'm new to java that's why i'm thinking of doing the same.what i actually want is that when user take his mouse to that button it should wait for some millisec and then change its position, but the problem i'm facing is that that button is not waiting as soon as i take my mouse to that it changes its position.
I tried to use 2 threads(one main and other created) but the thread which i create is not responding
